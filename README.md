# Agentic Email Client

## Project Overview
Instead of building email client in the traditional way (Frontend + Backend + Database), this email client is build with only Large Language Model (LLM) + tools + browser communications, and everything else is simulate by the LLM.

This is an implementation to build a Fuzzy Land first system, where it has the ability to scale with LLM improvement without having to write any extra code.

## Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from the ideas presented in the following video:

## Next Actions
- Add delete email function tool to the LLM.
- Refine prompt for better navigation and full functionality for the email client.
